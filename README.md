## üí° Use Case

The app was originally designed to be a **party-friendly interface** running on a Raspberry Pi with a (not mobile native) touchscreen, enabling guests to interact with the Spotify queue **without mobile devices or host intervention.**

The idea came to my mind to have a small side project with a kind of useful scope for my wifes' 30th birthday surprise party.
(Side fact: The party was a "Harry Potter" themed party, that's why I created a custom "gryffindor" theme which can be chosen within the header when running the app ‚ö°üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

It‚Äôs the perfect **contact point** at a party:  
Guests can browse, search, and queue songs ‚Äì but they can‚Äôt disrupt the flow.
